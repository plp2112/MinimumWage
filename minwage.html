		<div class="headlineDiv"> Minimum Wage Over Time</div>
		
		<div class="textDiv"><p class="text"> The minimum wage was was first set at $0.25 per hour in 1938, the equivalent of $4.19 in 2014 dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. States must abide by the federal minimum, now $7.25 per hour, although some state laws exceed that. New York has generally hovered at or slightly above the federal minimum wage since its inception. From 1962 to 1981, the state minimum wage went up every one to four years before it stagnated for about a decade during the 1980s.  </p>
			
		<p class="text"> Barnard College Economics Professor David Weiman said the minimum wage was most valuable in 1968. Census data shows the median monthly cost for a New York rental plus utilities was about $886, adjusted for inflation. The minimum wage was $1.60 per hour, or $10.86 in 2014 dollars. </p>
		
		<p class="text"> “Even though the nominal value may have been lower, it was actually higher. So, when folks are talking about wanting $15 and others say, ‘You’re out of your mind,' they can point to this historical experience,” Weiman said. </p>
			
		<p class="text"> A coalition of local politicians recently proposed a Fair Wage Act, which sets out to create a living wage in the city. It would require large employers and chain stores to pay their employees $15 an hour indexed to inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, New York’s minimum wage is $2 short of what it would need to be to keep up with the cost of living. </p>

	<p class="text">“New York’s minimum wage does not go far enough to keep families out of poverty. Large chains, from McDonalds to 7-Eleven, have higher profits and lower costs, yet they still pay their workers poverty wages,” said bill sponsor state Sen. Daniel Squadron. </p>
	<p class="text"> At issue is what workers are entitled to at the most basic level. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that the federal minimum wage is constitutional, but is it intended to be a living wage? The Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the minimum wage, says its purpose is to correct and eliminate “labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.” The 1938 law aims “to provide for the establishment of fair labor standards in employments in and affecting interstate commerce, and for other purposes.” But what’s fair is up for debate.</p>
	<p class="text"> Critics oppose a living wage because they believe it limits business interests. One argument is that employers are less inclined to make hires when they have to pay employees more money. </p>
	<p class="text"> “But that’s more of a theoretical argument. Empirical evidence shows that at best there’s maybe a small effect, possibly even no effect,” Weiman said. </p>
	<p class="text"> A letter signed by more than 600 economists, recently sent to President Barack Obama urged Congress to index the minimum wage against inflation, but to do so would require considerable political maneuvering. </p>
	<p class="text"> “There’s got to be some legislation and that’s really hard, whether it’s state legislation or Congress. That’s the problem,” Weiman said. “During 1980s, there was no coalition that would increase the nominal wage, so the real value deteriorated pretty sharply.” </p> 
	<p class="text"> The minimum wage in New York and across the nation held at $3.35 an hour from 1981 until 1990, but it would have been $5 an hour if it had kept up with the cost of living. The gap between the cost of living and the minimum wage has fluctuated but remained. The federal minimum wage was last raised in 2009 and has lost about 5.8 percent of its buying power to inflation. </p>
